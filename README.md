# My old portfolio site
You can visit it [here](https://andyisland.netlify.app/). It was made using React, Typescript, Three.js, and React Three Fiber, but it didn't work well for a portfolio site since it took too long to load. My portfolio links were eventually replaced by my [blog](https://skraggl.io/blog) on [Skraggl.io](https://skraggl.io/).
